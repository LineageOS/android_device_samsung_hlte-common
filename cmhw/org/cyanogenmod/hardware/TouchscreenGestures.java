 * Touchscreen gestures API
 *
 * A device may implement several touchscreen gestures for use while
 * the display is turned off, such as drawing alphabets and shapes.
 * These gestures can be interpreted by userspace to activate certain
 * actions and launch certain apps, such as to skip music tracks,
 * to turn on the flashlight, or to launch the camera app.
 *
 * This *should always* be supported by the hardware directly.
 * A lot of recent touch controllers have a firmware option for this.
 *
 * This API provides support for enumerating the gestures
 * supported by the touchscreen.
